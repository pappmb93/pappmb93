- 👋 Hi, I’m Bence (Fun fact: I'm a BA, not a DEV from 9 to 5)
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity and app development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cybersecurity, how to make my Python code cleaner and better. Future plans include learning a modern front-end technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where junior level coders can learn, while making an impact.
- 📫 How to reach me on Discord at Majksz7#9843.
